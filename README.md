## About

### NumFOCUS

The PyData conference series is organized by NumFOCUS, a non-proﬁt organization which supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open-source scientiﬁc software. NumFOCUS aims to ensure that money is available to keep projects in the scientiﬁc Python stack funded and open. So if you ﬁnd value in these tools and have always wanted to give back, donating to NumFOCUS gives you a way of supporting either a speciﬁc project of your choice or all of these great codes at once. NumFOCUS website.

### PyData

Starting with a PyData Workshop at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA, in 2012 PyData has evolved into a successful conference series on using Python for the management, processing, analysis, and visualization of data. Alongside the popular conferences and the excellent PyData tools/packages, a steadily growing PyData community has formed.

### PyData Delhi

PyData Delhi is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. A primary goal of the meetup is to provide a venue for users across all the various domains of data analysis to share their experiences and their techniques, as well as highlight the most triumphs and potential pitfalls of using Python for certain kinds of problems.
